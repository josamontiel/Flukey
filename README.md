# Truly Random password generator

A python CLI program that allows for the generation of truly secure and random PINs, passwords or passphrases.

A few changes have been made since the start:

1. Each option has now been separated into their own respective functions, allowing for easy editing, omission and addition. 
2. I have now figured out how to allow for the user to select between creating a PIN, password or passphrase.


## What was fixed:
- A bug that repeated the question when prompted. 

## What I added:

A progressbar animation for a little something extra

example: if you selected option 2 (Password) you were then asked the question again and only after the second attempt would it execute the password_gen() function. 

> CAUTION: This password generator is not field tested, please understand that if you decide to use this that you are doing so at your own risk.
