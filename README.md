# Truly Random password generator

A python CLI program that allows for the generation of truly secure and random PINs, passwords or passphrases.

A few changes have been made since the start:

1. Each option has now been separated into their own respective functions, allowing for easy editing, omission and addition. 
2. I have now figured out how to allow for the user to select between creating a PIN, password or passphrase.


> TO BE FIXED:
> At present, with the current if statement ``` gen_choices()``` what is happening is that it cycles through the initial question multiple times. 
> What I ***may*** have to do is turn it into a while loop? Not entirely sure yet, but functionally, the program works as intended. 

> CAUTION: This password generator is not field tested, please understand that if you decide to use this that you are doing so at your own risk.
