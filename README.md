# Truly Random password generator

A python CLI program that allows for the generation of truly secure and random PINs, passwords or passphrases.

A few changes have been made since the start:

1. Each option has now been separated into their own respective functions, allowing for easy editing, omission and addition. 
2. I have now figured out how to allow for the user to select between creating a PIN, password or passphrase.


## What was fixed:
- A bug that repeated the question when prompted. 

## Screenshots:
