# Truly Random password generator

A python CLI program that allows for the generation of truly secure and random passwords.

As you can see it is only a couple lines of code (as of 10 Nov only 7 lines) so the use of libraries really does allow developers to shrink the amount of code they need to write allowing for cleaner code bases. 

At present it only does two things:

1. Asks user for desires P/W length.
2. Displays generated P/W of nLength.

Eventual generation of PINs and Multi-Word Passphrases is being worked in, at present I am also creating Objects as to abstract the key functions of the program into a couple of separate but detailed objects (Choosing what to generate and separate objects for each of the selections)

> CAUTION: This password generator is not field tested, please understand that if you decide to use this that you are doing so at your own risk.
