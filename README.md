# Truly Random password generator

A python CLI program that allows for the generation of truly secure and random passwords.

As you can see it is only a couple lines of code (as of 10 Nov only 7 lines) so the use of libraries really does allow developers to shrink the amount of code they need to write allowing for cleaner code bases. 

At present it only does two things:

1. Asks user for desires P/W length.
2. Displays generated P/W of nLength.

### What is in the pipeline for this program:

Essentially what I wish to achieve with this program is the ability to allow users to decide whether they would like to generate an alpha-numeric p/w or a pin number. 

> CAUTION: This password generator is not field tested, please understand that if you decide to use this that you are doing so at your own risk.
